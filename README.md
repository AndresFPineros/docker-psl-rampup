# Docker PSL Ramp Up for .Net Developers

## Introduction
The purpose of this Ramp Up is to provide a set of challenges that will allow .Net Developers to create and deploy their own applications using Docker while following the best practices and leveraging the set of Docker Tools from Vistual Studio.


## Considerations
Even though the Ramp Up can be ran from a Windows or a Linux Machine, we'll focus on Linux Containers because they are widely used compared to Windows Containers and are probably what most projects in cloud environments use.

### Stage: Getting Started

#### [Study Plan](study_plans/getting_started.md)
- Installing Docker
- Deploying a first Docker container
- Get to know the sources of information.
  
-----

### Stage: Learning Docker
#### [Study Plan](study_plans/learning_docker.md)
- What is a Docker container?
- What is the Docker Engine?
- Lifecycle of a Docker container.
- Exposing your application's port.
- Debugging a running container.
- Persisting Data with Containers.
#### Challenge
- Create a Dockerhub account.
- Create a public repository for a custom image.
- Create a Dockerfile for an Nginx image pre-packed with a HTML file saying "Hello World"
- Push the image
- Remove the image locally
-----

### Stage: Learning Docker for .Net
#### [Study Plan](study_plans/dotnet_docker.md)
- Docker images for .Net Core.
- Dockerfile examples for .Net Core.
#### Challenge
- Create a basic web application using the DotnetCore web framework. The application should have a simple controller that handles the /helloworld endpoint. Dockerize the application using the official Docker images provided by Microsoft.
- Expose the application to your local machine using ports and access the endpoint from your browser.
- Push the application to Dockerhub.
-----

### Stage: Orchestration with Docker-Compose
#### Study Plan
- Docker Networks
- Communicating two containers with links
- What is docker-compose?
- Docker-compose concepts: serivcename, replicas, service and stacks.
- Importance of Docker-Compose in development environments.
- Docker-Compose vs Kubernetes.
#### Challenge
- Modify the previous application you created to include the logic to query a simple attribute from a MySQL or SQL Server database. Make sure your application is stateless because it has to scale up.
- Create a docker-compose deployment that creates the application and database with a single `docker-compose up`. You should connect the application to the database somehow.
- The database should be persitent, this means that you should be able to remove the container without loosing the data.
- Increase the amount of replicas of your service to 3.

-----

### Stage: Learning Visual Studio Tools for Docker
#### Objectives
#### Study Plan
- Install Visual Studio Tools for Docker
- Explore Visual Studio Tools for Docker
- Autogenerate Dockerfile for application.
- Autogenerate Docker-Compose file for application.
#### Challenge
- Deploy an autogenerated docker-compose application for the application you've been working on.
- The application should be deployed and debuggued from theV Visual Studio IDE instead of a terminal.

-----

### Stage: Going Back to Advanced Topics
#### Study Plan
- Best practices
  - Build Optimization
  - Multi-stage builds
  - Security (rootless containers)
- Namespaces and CGroups
- Exploring the Docker filesystem (/var/docker/containers)
- Docker Network Overlay
